# Yunzai-Bot giveTitle plugin (by .js)
I'm sorry to tell you that , due to my laziness , all texts below are translated by [Baidu Translate](https://fanyi.baidu.com/) .
If you can not read Chinese , I suggest that you should just install `giveTitle.js` into `Yunzai-Bot/plugins/example` .
But if you can read Chinese , opening the [README.md](https://gitee.com/CUZNIL/Yunzai-giveTitle/blob/master/README.md) is recommended .
Of course , if you 闲得慌 , I won't stop you keep reading .
